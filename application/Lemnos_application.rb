Core Technology:
  - modular cheap / fast liquid handling
  - os independent: web server which also allows remote control
  - copy + paste liquid handling operations ( online repo ? )

Market Size / Target Customers
  - OEMs, biotechs / syn bio, industrial chem, pharma, diagnostics labs
  - Thermo Fisher, BASF, Mylan, Quest Diagnostics, Life Technologies "speed challenge" with 1M bounty
  - avoid academia ? not incentivized as they have a glut of grad students
  - primary concern is that a single client of this size would be all I need >> both a huge benefit and investment

Business Model
  - would love to open source some aspect -- tbd
  - exclusivity agreement as sole provider of the lh002 for length of contract
  - work to customize hardware + addons / expand tech

Team Bios
  carl crott
    - owned and operated black-glass web design company
    - quit previous startup job w specific intent to work in silicon valley biotech
    - nlp chemoinformatics parsing app: http://stark-fire-6273.herokuapp.com/chemoinformatics ( ask me to enable backend =] )
    - versed in: python, ajax, java, linux, c, html, css, autocad, solidworks, business marketing, mathematics, biology
    - aligned human genome na92040 on 40 cores of ec2 instances ( can provide the complete genome on request )
    - prototyped the lh001 and peristaltic pump

  co-founder x
    - python + c coder
    - electrical engineering background
    - someone from stanford, caltech, ucla ?

Budget / Tech -- 5mo @ 50k
  Tech / Timeline:
  - start program with:
    - completed initial completed schematic
    - finished supplier list
  - order parts ( sooner > later )
  - assembly: no more than 2 iterations of the build to working prototype
    - 3000 for inital testing / revision setup ( 1 core + main rail assembly )
    - 14000 for full 12-core prototype
  - machine fine-tuning in order:
    - make it work: positioning code, encoders @ sub-mm accuracy to place within 7mm envelope repeatibly ( duh )
    - make it fast: maximizing non-blocking operations, testing on stepper velocities/loads/resonance points
    - make it pretty: may or may not... but ive got the design background ( specifics of selling to oems )
  - presentation of codified liquid handling protocols
  - quickie website with pretty design and a few prices for models
