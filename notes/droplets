The mass of a drop of water, m, hanging from a capiliary tube of radius a may be estimated by:

m = (2π a γ cosθ) / g

where:
γ is the surface tension of water = 72 x 10^-3 N m-¹ (at 25 ˚C in air)
θ is the water-glass contact angle ~ 14˚
g is the acceleration due to gravity 9.81 kg m s-²

the volume of the water droplet, V = m / ρ where ρ is density of water = 997 kg m-³ (at 25 ˚C).

Therefore V = (2π a γ cosθ) / ρg.

For a dropper of radius a = 2 mm, subsituting gives V ~ 1 x 10^-7 m³ or 0.1 cm³.
