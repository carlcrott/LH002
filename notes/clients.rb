Open source is obviously disruptive, I mean if I dropped an automated liquid handler, sans a few features at 1/10th the cost obviously you would take note.

The issue is " how do we commercialize "
example open source hardware companies such as arduino and linux do this through both customization and service packages. IE capitalizing on their expertise.

How does hardware become the defacto platform?
What happens when that platform is comoditized?
How does a company capitalize on this position?

Obviously it would be unwise to ignu ore the impact of open source... but how do you make it profitable?

IEEE has published numerous papers on how 'disruptive' open source is [1,2,3]


What im interested in is if we can find sufficient overlap in our corresponding specialty.

Open source helps to create an open platform, and then allows you to stay competitive with economies of scale, specialzation or other.

Open source:
- speed of development
- low cost

VRS

Protected source:
- quality of features
- quality of performance

Notes:
- not asking you to give away your technology
- asking for some sponsorship in specialized parts

What does it mean for the end consumer:
- lower costs
- more automation
- increased customization
- repeatibility on protocols within the machine << scale will create feedback


Specifically what I want from you:
- 20,000 for the guaranteed delivery of a first prototype
- design for modular heads / tools and standards for machine connections


Advantages of partnering with BGS:
- small enough that we can prototype very cost effectively
- we recognize that there is a glut of tech talent migrating to biotech and life sciences ( capitalize on this by allowing them an easy decision on which platform to design for )


What happens when medical research robots are cheap enough that every school can afford to purchase one? This is how adobe got to be the giant it is today... because theyve become the defacto platform for their market.


"The trick for robotics and AI companies will be to figure out the right mix of what’s proprietary and what’s open." [4]


"" WHAT IS CREATING VALUE? "" repeatibility, efficiency and more time for researchers above being liquid handling robotics == value





Who is doing it:
- Broadcom with the RaspberryPi -- and they had huge sales
- 


- Find people who work on open source laser cutters / repraps
