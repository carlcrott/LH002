In its current state the LH002 is very much a general high throughput system. It is cheap and modular and I plan to design additional features per the requests of those using the system.

The concept is to allow it to be expanded to match any throughput need. The primary unit of the machine is a single 8 channel pipette designed specifically to be stacked like server blades.

Features:
- Peristaltic pump @ 5uL accuracy
- Automated pipette tip swapping
- Accepts pipette tip heights from 1" to 3"
- Aspirate / Dispense
- Capacity for up to 10 blades per machine ( individual blades are the teal rectangles... Attached images are of a 4 blade system )
    - Throughput can be increased simply by adding additional blades.
- Each blade can be dedicated to dispense a single liquid OR as mixing channel 
    - Costs on disposables are lowered through dedicated function
    - Throughput is increased through this same dedicated function
- Current LH002 unit is capable of 10 blades
- Multiple units can be stitched together for as much liquid handling as needed
- Control software is wholly OS agnostic ( control server on a single machine )


I'm not too sure how deep into the architecture you guys are. But this machine is very much so built specifically to be tweaked, modified and tuned for specific applications.

If you'd like to dig into the protocols and the nitty gritty let me know!

Best of luck!
